A unified collection of lightweight, zero-dependency connectors giving **Grok Build** native access to third-party language models. These connectors bypass background daemons like `CLIProxyAPI` and instead run Node-native inline proxy servers on-the-fly.

## Interactive Configuration Console (TUI)

By cloning the parent repository `open-grok-build`, you get access to a root-level interactive TUI control panel. This zero-dependency CLI application lets you manage all your Grok Build connectors and settings dynamically.

```bash
./tui.js
```

### Features
* **📊 Live Status Monitor**: Checks the installation status of all connectors and reports their active default models.
* **🔄 Active Model Switcher**: Swap between connectors (`agy`, `codex`, `deepseek`) as the active default model in your `~/.grok/config.toml` with a single press.
* **⚙️ Option Adjuster**: Switch default models inside each connector (e.g. `gpt-5.5` vs `gpt-5.4` on Codex, or `gemini-3.5-flash` vs `gemini-3-pro` on AGY).
* **🚀 Quick Installer**: Install, re-install, or setup all connectors locally with execution logs rendered inline.
